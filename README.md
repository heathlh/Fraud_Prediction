# Fraud_Prediction
Predict Fraud Based on Transaction Information

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The model is trained on a dataset provided in HW3_training.csv and makes predictions on a test set given in HW3_test_input.csv. The methods considered in this project include linear regression, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and decision trees, as covered in our class.

## Data Description

HW3_training.csv: The training dataset contains labeled examples with features representing transaction attributes and a target indicating fraud or no fraud.

HW3_test_input.csv: The test dataset contains unlabeled examples for which the model will predict the likelihood of fraud.

## Model

The model(s) selected and the rationale for their selection are based on their performance and appropriateness for the problem at hand. The chosen model is evaluated using the F1 score to measure its accuracy on the test data.
